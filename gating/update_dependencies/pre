# Dependency updates are checked periodically. A project should codify the the
# process for updating the working directory of the repository with any changes
# to upstream dependencies. If changes are made, the job will automatically
# create a new pull request.

# pre is an optional executable for preparing the node prior to running the
# build. This step is retried on failure given that it performs preparatory
# actions and not the actual function of the job. Examples of actions that
# should be taken here include things that would be performed manually such as
# setting configuration options.
