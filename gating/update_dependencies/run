# Dependency updates are checked periodically. A project should codify the the
# process for updating the working directory of the repository with any changes
# to upstream dependencies. If changes are made, the job will automatically
# create a new pull request.

# run is a required executable that executes the purpose of the job. For
# example, if the project deploys some software, this file would be used to
# perform the deployment and then test the success of the operation.

# Environment variables
# READ_ONLY_TEST: When set to false a pull request is created to update any
# dependencies that have changed.
